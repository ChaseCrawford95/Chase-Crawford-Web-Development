    <p>Hello and welcome to my personal profile website! This project is to display my aptitude for computer programming/software engineering. 
        This website alone is designed to show my skills utilizing JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This website is built and designed by me! Everything from the Portfolio page is going to be either personal projects or assignments from the various CS classes that I have taken. 
        Hopefully this site will prove my prowess as a backend developer and my artistic touch as a frontend developer(that might take a bit...).</p>
    
    <h3>A little bit about me</h3>
    
    <p>I was born on May 29th, 1995, in Birmingham, Alabama. I was raised in Leeds, in the same state. After I graduated high school from Pelham, I signed a six-year contract and enlisted in the United States Air Force. 
        At the end of my contract, I decided to leave the USAF and try to obtain a BSN in Nursing. I got into the nursing program at the University of Alabama at Birmingham but soon found out it was not for me. 
        My reasoning for choosing a STEM degree was from one lecture in nursing school where they were discussing the subject of caring for patients that have prosthetic limbs. My mind drifted and focused on making a more technologically advanced prosthetic arm/hand. 
        The idea landed on creating a prosthetic arm/hand that picks up the synaptic pulse signals from the body's neurological system. Then with those biological signals, send the correct inputs to the prosthetic arm/hand to make it move the way the user wants it to. 
        I self-reflected and realized that it would be best for me to go into the STEM world if I were going to think of ideas like that. I choose Computer Science, and I can conceptualize and compartmentalize the subject material. 
        Kind of figures coming from the son of a civil engineer.</p>
