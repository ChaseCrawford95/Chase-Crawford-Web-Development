                        <p>Hi, I'm Chase Crawford, a Junior Software Engineer with expertise in Software Engineering, Web Development, 
                            and Mobile Application Development. After serving in the United States Air Force, I earned my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at the University of Alabama 
                            at Birmingham, graduating with a 3.56 GPA and Cum Laude honors. Additionally, I obtained a minor in 
                            Business Administration. I have a proven track record in Front-End Development, Back-End 
                            Development, and Full Stack Development. My ability to collaborate seamlessly in team 
                            environments is complemented by my proficiency in working independently. I have experience 
                            with Back-End Programming Languages that are the likes of: Python(With Flask), Java, JavaFX, C, Kotlin, Swift, 
                            and Assembly. I have experience with the Front-End technologies that are the likes of: HTML, 
                            CSS, XML, and FXML. I have experience with the relational database technology of SQL/SQLite. 
                            My IDEs of choice are that of: VSCode, Android Stuido(Android Development/Kotlin), and Xcode(iOS Development/Swift).
